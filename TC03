//TC_03-To verify that when user enters invalid portal URL , error message is displayed

//This code opens a Chrome browser and tries to load an invalid URL. It uses a try-catch-finally block to handle the process safely. 
//The code in the try block attempts to open the page. If the URL is invalid and causes an error, the catch block runs to confirm the 
//error occurred and marks the test as passed. The finally block always runs after try or catch to close the browser, making sure no resources are left open. 
//This structure ensures the test handles errors smoothly and cleans up properly every time.
